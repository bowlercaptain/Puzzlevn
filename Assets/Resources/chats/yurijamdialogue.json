What can I get for ya?\n#Load Ruth\n????:O-hi. Could I get... two carne asada tacos and a... cherry Funta?\nAanya:Sure, coming right up!\nAanya*:Isn't her earring from Parallax Eons? I wonder...\n????:Oh! Sorry, but could you hold the peppers, onions, cilantro, salsa, and side carrots?\nAanya*:Oh. Plain, huh?\nAanya:So, just plain beef tacos?\n????:Errr... yeah. Thanks.\nAanya*:Maybe Boss will let me have this taco then...\nAanya:Here you go, have a good one!.\n????:Thanks, you too.\nAanya:Love your earring, by the way. Glory to the Redfields!\n????:Declare victory!\nAanya*:She posed with her fist to the sky, clutching the cherry Funta.\n????:!!!\n????:.....\nAanya*:...I guess I got a little carried away...\nAanya: Umm... here's some napkins and... um... a fork.\n????:...thanks...\nAanya:...\nAanya:Oh hey, the line's gone. Hey Boss. Can I take my lunch now?\nBoss:*nod*\nAanya:Hey Boss. Can I have this mis-taco?\nBoss:*nod*\nAanya:Thanks boss. I'll be back in 30.\n#Change background here\n#Load Ruth\nAanya:Hi again! Mind if I sit here?\n????:!!!\n????:Go ahead.\nAanya:Thanks.\n????:...\nAanya:...\n????:.....*munch*\nAanya:.....\nAanya*:Do I... say anything?\n->I really should...\n    Aanya:...\n    ????:...\n    Aanya:.....\n->Say something...\n->But...\n    Aanya:...\n    ????:...\n    Aanya:.....\nAanya:So you play Parallax?\nAanya*:Wow. Just... wow.\n????:Yeah.\n????:...\nAanya*:Erm... what now?\n->\"Nice weathe-\"\n    ????:D-\n    Aanya:Nic-\n    Aanya*:Crap.\n    Aanya:Go ahead, you first.\n    ????:Mm.\n->Am I seriously gonna talk about the weather?@timer@550\n????:Do you play?\nAanya:Yup. My parent's got me a GS Rita for Christmas last year, and this was the promo game it had.\n#Ruth shake\n????:Wait, you got the promo version!? Lucky... that came with the GS exclusive 'Intention Flux' armor set...\nAanya*:Even though...\n->It wasn't as strong as the armor set I already had...\n    Aanya:The promo set wasn't really that strong though.\n    ????:Isn't it better that way? Like really strong items can only be obtained by hard work.\n    Aanya*:Or money.\n    Aanya:I've found it kinda weird that these legendary items aren't as good as some of the rare ones, though.\n    ????:But if everyone just picked the strongest item, the game would look really... silly. I mean, I still use 'Paradox Manual' even though 'Matter Formula' is strictly better.\n    ????:Sometimes you just want to use an item that your character would enjoy!\n    Aanya*:Like all the players that wear cosmetic armor into battle for... roleplaying?\n->It still looked really cool.\n    Aanya:The art they used for it was really beautiful.\n    ????:Right? The lore behind the set sent shivers down my spine! I think the Masked Queen is one of my favorite NPCs.\n    Aanya:She was the one that turned all of the captured prisoners into mirror copies of herself, right?\n    Aanya*:I also believe that was the fight that everyone complained about because it was way too hard...\n    ????:Yeah! I just loved how atmospheric the fight felt.\n    ????:I mean, until you were ganked by a dozen copies.\n    ????:But the throne room her fight was in... the detail in all the chains running across the floor...\n    ????:You felt in the presence of a real queen.\n#Ruth ringtone\n????:Ah.\n????:I gotta head back to work. Maybe I'll see you again?\nAanya*:No doubt, i'm here Monday through Friday.\nAanya:Most likely.\nAanya:...\nAanya*:She was a nice person.\nAanya*:...\nAanya:I forgot to ask her name.\n#END SCENE 1\n[[Act1_Scene2_s]]",

Really?\nAanya:Alright, here you are. Have a good one!\nProbably Becky:You too! Thanks a ton.\n#Load Ruth\nAanya*:Oh hey, it's...\n->that girl that ordered plain tacos.\n    Aanya*:I-is this really okay?\n->that girl that declared victory a la Redfield.\n    Aanya*:I mean, it was memorable...\n->that girl who really likes Parallax Eons.\n    Aanya*:I wonder if she played to new patch yet...\nAanya*:I... should ask her real name.\nAanya:Hey, how's it going? I didn't catch your name yesterday. I'm Aanya.\nRuth:Ruth.\nAanya:What can I get for ya?\nAanya*:Although I think I already know.\nRuth:I'll have two carne asada tacos and a cherry Funta, hold the veggies and salsa please.\nAanya:Sounds good.\n#Hide Ruth\nAanya*:I wonder if Boss'll let me take my lunch now.\nBoss:*nod*\nAanya:...\nAanya:*nod*\nAanya*:H-how did they know?\nAanya*:...a-anyway...tacos. Plaaaain tacos.\n#Load Ruth\nAanya:Here you are. Boss let me take my lunch now. If you don't mind, can I eat with you?\nRuth:Oh! Sure. That'd be nice.\nAanya:Do you work in one of the office buildings near here?\nRuth:Mm. I work in the 3T building, doing customer service work.\nRuth:...\nRuth:It's boring, but I ought to count myself as lucky to even have steady work in this era.\nAanya:You also have some moderately delicious tacos just down the way too!\nRuth:That too. Say...\nAanya:Hm?\nRuth:Did you play the new patch for Parallax? They added some new content stuff and a few quests.\nAanya:No, not yet. It was still downloading when I woke up today, so I was going to play it when I got home.\nAanya*:Speaking of... I should probably complain to my net provider...\nRuth:I haven't either. If you don't have work tomorrow, do you wanna party up? We could meet at the net cafe and play the new raids.\nAanya:What time would we be meeting up? I'm... not really an early riser on weekends if I don't have to.\nRuth: I was thinking around 2 or so.\nAanya*:About an hour to get ready... then half and hour...\nAanya:Sounds good to me. Just in case, wanna trade phone numbers?\nRuth:Sure. Oh, and texting is okay for me.\nAanya:Same.\nAanya*:Huh, her phone number has three sevens in a row...\nAanya: There.\nRuth:Great! I saw online that they were making it a double xp weekend on top of the new content patch, so I wanted to ask you today.\nAanya*:It's been a while since i've taken advantage of the party up bonus rewards, too...\n#Ruth Alarm\nAanya:So i'll see you tomorrow at... Infinium?\nRuth: Yeah, that one's the most comfortable. 2 o'clock then!\nAanya*:I... probably shouldn't get a head start on the patch.\nAanya*:...\n->I really shouldn't...\n    [[Act1_Scene3_a]]\n->It wouldn't be fair...\n    [[Act1_Scene3_a]]\n->I mean... maybe just the solo content...\n    [[Act1_Scene3_b]]\n#END SCENE 2",

We can't go into a raid without knowing each other's capabilities. That's just common sense.\nAanya:Right, that makes sense. Here.\nRuth:So you're a Guardian Knight type, huh? That's a relief!\nAanya:You play a casting class?\nRuth:Yeah, Reverent Wizard type. Specializing in both DoTs and party healing! My equipment is mainly focusing on the DoT though.\nRuth:I liked the playstyle that came with it. You stack up a lot of damage when the fight first starts, then switch over to heals until the DoT wears off.\nRuth:I guess... it keeps me engaged with all parts of a raid, both allies and enemies.\nAanya:Huh. I guess the pure damage classes only have to worry about their enemies health and their own cooldowns. And even the guardian only really needs to keep an eye on enemy aggro.\nRuth:The only class that doesn't really need to pay any attention is the Aegis Bulwark.\nAanya:Yeah, it just stands there.\nAanya*:I can't possibly say that I was originally going to play one...\nRuth:So, you ready to start the raid?\nAanya:Yeah, just let me pick up some pots and stuff and i'll be good to go.\n#Finish up with some raid dialogue!",
