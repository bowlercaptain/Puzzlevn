I wonder...\n????:Oh! Sorry, but could you hold the peppers, onions, cilantro, salsa, and side carrots?\nAanya*:Oh. Plain, huh?\nAanya:So, just plain beef tacos?\n????:Errr... yeah. Thanks.\nAanya*:Maybe Boss will let me have this taco then...\nAanya:Here you go, have a good one!.\n????:Thanks, you too.\nAanya:Love your earring, by the way. Glory to the Redfields!\n????:Declare victory!\nAanya*:She posed with her fist to the sky, clutching the cherry Funta.\n????:!!!\n????:.....\nAanya*:...I guess I got a little carried away...\nAanya: Umm... here's some napkins and... um... a fork.\n????:...thanks...\nAanya:...\nAanya:Oh hey, the line's gone. Hey Boss. Can I take my lunch now?\nBoss:*nod*\nAanya:Hey Boss. Can I have this mis-taco?\nBoss:*nod*\nAanya:Thanks boss. I'll be back in 30.\n#Change background here\n#Load Ruth\nAanya:Hi again! Mind if I sit here?\n????:!!!\n????:Go ahead.\nAanya:Thanks.\n????:...\nAanya:...\n????:.....*munch*\nAanya:.....\nAanya*:Do I... say anything?\n->I really should...\n    Aanya:...\n    ????:...\n    Aanya:.....\n->Say something...\n->But...\n    Aanya:...\n    ????:...\n    Aanya:.....\nAanya:So you play Parallax?\nAanya*:Wow. Just... wow.\n????:Yeah.\n????:...\nAanya*:Erm... what now?\n->\"Nice weathe-\"\n    ????:D-\n    Aanya:Nic-\n    Aanya*:Crap.\n    Aanya:Go ahead, you first.\n    ????:Mm.\n->Am I seriously gonna talk about the weather?@timer@550\n????:Do you play?\nAanya:Yup. My parent's got me a GS Rita for Christmas last year, and this was the promo game it had.\n#Ruth shake\n????:Wait, you got the promo version!? Lucky... that came with the GS exclusive 'Intention Flux' armor set...\nAanya*:Even though...\n->It wasn't as strong as the armor set I already had...\n    Aanya:The promo set wasn't really that strong though.\n    ????:Isn't it better that way? Like really strong items can only be obtained by hard work.\n    Aanya*:Or money.\n    Aanya:I've found it kinda weird that these legendary items aren't as good as some of the rare ones, though.\n    ????:But if everyone just picked the strongest item, the game would look really... silly. I mean, I still use 'Paradox Manual' even though 'Matter Formula' is strictly better.\n    ????:Sometimes you just want to use an item that your character would enjoy!\n    Aanya*:Like all the players that wear cosmetic armor into battle for... roleplaying?\n->It still looked really cool.\n    Aanya:The art they used for it was really beautiful.\n    ????:Right? The lore behind the set sent shivers down my spine! I think the Masked Queen is one of my favorite NPCs.\n    Aanya:She was the one that turned all of the captured prisoners into mirror copies of herself, right?\n    Aanya*:I also believe that was the fight that everyone complained about because it was way too hard...\n    ????:Yeah! I just loved how atmospheric the fight felt.\n    ????:I mean, until you were ganked by a dozen copies.\n    ????:But the throne room her fight was in... the detail in all the chains running across the floor...\n    ????:You felt in the presence of a real queen.\n#Ruth ringtone\n????:Ah.\n????:I gotta head back to work. Maybe I'll see you again?\nAanya*:No doubt, i'm here Monday through Friday.\nAanya:Most likely.\nAanya:...\nAanya*:She was a nice person.\nAanya*:...\nAanya:I forgot to ask her name.\n#END SCENE 1\n[[Act1_Scene2_s]]",
