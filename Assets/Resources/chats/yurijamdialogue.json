My parent's got me a GS Rita for Christmas last year, and this was the promo game it had.\n#Ruth shake\n????:Wait, you got the promo version!? Lucky... that came with the GS exclusive 'Intention Flux' armor set...\nAanya*:It did have that armor, didn't it?\n->It wasn't as strong as the armor set I already had...\n    Aanya:The promo set wasn't really that strong though.\n    ????:Isn't it better that way? Like really strong items can only be obtained by hard work.\n    Aanya*:Or money.\n    Aanya:I've found it kinda weird that a lot of the so-called legendary items aren't as good as some of the rare ones, though.\n    ????:But if everyone just picked the strongest item, the game would look really... silly. I mean, I still use 'Paradox Manual' even though 'Matter Formula' is strictly better.\n    ????:Sometimes you just want to use an item that your character would enjoy!\n    Aanya*:Like all the players that wear cosmetic armor into battle for... roleplaying?\n->It still looked really cool.\n    Aanya:The art they used for it was really beautiful.\n    ????:Right? The lore behind the set sent shivers down my spine! I think the Masked Queen is one of my favorite NPCs.\n    Aanya:She was the one that turned all of the captured prisoners into mirror copies of herself, right?\n    Aanya*:I also believe that was the fight that everyone complained about because it was way too hard...\n    ????:Yeah! I just loved how atmospheric the fight felt.\n    ????:I mean, until you were ganked by a dozen copies.\n    ????:But the throne room her fight was in... the detail in all the chains running across the floor...\n    ????:You felt in the presence of a real queen.\n#Ruth ringtone\n????:Ah.\n????:I gotta head back to work. Maybe I'll see you again?\nAanya*:No doubt, i'm here Monday through Friday.\nAanya:Most likely.\nAanya:...\nAanya*:She was a nice person.\nAanya*:...\nAanya:I forgot to ask her name.\n#END SCENE 1\n[[Act1_Scene2_s]]",

I work in the 3T building, doing customer service work.\nRuth:...\nRuth:It's boring, but I ought to count myself as lucky to even have steady work in this era.\nAanya:You also have some moderately delicious tacos just down the way too!\nRuth:That too. But aside from that...\nAanya:Hm?\nRuth:Did you play the new patch for Parallax? They added some new content stuff and a few quests.\nAanya:No, not yet. It was still downloading when I woke up today, so I was going to play it when I got home.\nAanya*:Speaking of... I should probably complain to my net provider...\nRuth:I haven't either. If you don't have work tomorrow, do you wanna party up? We could meet at the net cafe and play the new raids.\nAanya:What time would we be meeting up? I'm... not really an early riser on weekends if I don't have to.\nRuth: I was thinking around 2 or so.\nAanya*:About an hour to get ready... then half and hour...\nAanya:Sounds good to me. Just in case, wanna trade phone numbers?\nRuth:Sure. Oh, and texting is okay for me.\nAanya:Same.\nAanya*:Huh, her phone number has three sevens in a row...\nAanya: There.\nRuth:Great!

We can't go into a raid without knowing each other's capabilities. That's just common sense.\nAanya:Right, that makes sense. Here.\nRuth:So you're a Guardian Knight type, huh? That's a relief!\nAanya:You play a casting class?\nRuth:Yeah, Reverent Wizard type. Specializing in both DoTs and party healing! My equipment is mainly focusing on the DoT though.\nRuth:I liked the playstyle that came with it. You stack up a lot of damage when the fight first starts, then switch over to heals until the DoT wears off.\nRuth:I guess... it keeps me engaged with all parts of a raid, both allies and enemies.\nAanya:Huh. I guess the pure damage classes only have to worry about their enemies health and their own cooldowns. And even the guardian only really needs to keep an eye on enemy aggro.\nRuth:The only class that doesn't really need to pay any attention is the Aegis Bulwark.\nAanya:Yeah, it just stands there.\nAanya*:I can't possibly say that I was originally going to play one...\nRuth:So, you ready to start the raid?\nAanya:Yup. I'm loaded in.\nRuth:Great! I'll go ahead and let you take aggro as soon as we get inside.\nRuth:...!\nRuth:Wow!!! Look at the size of that thing! And the detail in it's wings!\nAanya*:Great... a flying raid boss... this'll be a pain.\nAanya:Alright! I'm taking aggro!\nRuth:Laying down my damage, will switch to heals after.\nAanya*:You know...\nRuth:Aanya, you're buffed!

I got my lunch break, too.\nRuth:Is your Boss really that lax? I mean, it seems weird that you can take lunch with me every week.\nAanya:To be honest, it is a little strange. They are normally really strict, especially when the line is really long.\nAanya:But when it comes to you, Boss is really... lenient.\nAanya:I mean, you do come at the end of the lunch rush, and it's not like my job is really that hard.

And at best, I get to make new friends, right?\nRuth:The people I deal with always want me to instantly solve their problems. I wish they would just realize that I can't just turn it off and back on again for them.\nRuth:And there are the people who blame you for not being able to solve their problems, even though they are the one's that got themselves into that mess in the first place!\nRuth:I really can't stand the people that take their own stupid problems out on those trying to help them. It's just... rude.\nAanya*:I know that feeling. There's always some jerk who thinks they are above you. I've considered having a special hot sauce just for those people.\nRuth:I wish more people gave a damn about treating each other right. Most of us who work there just want to live our lives free of shit like that.\nRuth:Why should I have to keep saying \"yes ma'am\" or \"i'm sorry, ma'am\" to someone who treats me like that?\nAanya:Have you tried talking with your managers? I went to a customer service training a while back when I first started up at the truck. There was a list of rules for maintaining workplace safety alongside good service standards.\nAanya:One of the baseline rules was: \"Don't accept abuse from customers.\"\nAanya:Managers are usually trained to handle disruptive customers, so they'd rather deal with them in a way that satisfies everyone as best as possible without risking a hurt employee.\nAanya:Not to mention avoiding physical violence.\nRuth:But I did try that. When I said I was going to get my manager to help, the customer just lashed out at me, telling me that I should be fired for not knowing how to fix their stupid problem.\nAanya:But that-\nRuth:And once my manager finished talking to them, she just told me to \"toughen up\", as if it were my fault for not being able to handle that.\nAanya:You shouldn't... i'm sorry about that.

At that point a lot turned around for me.\nRuth:Something about the grind, the hard work that paid off really got me. I started to treat myself like my avatar.\nRuth:And it showed. I got myself new work clothes, tried to eat healthier, and got myself into a routine where my life became tolerable again.\nRuth:And for a while, that worked. At work, I would just do my job, and at home I would focus on taking care of myself.\nAanya:That's pretty admirable, honestly.\nRuth:I'm not admirable.\nAanya:W-what do you mean?\nRuth:...\nRuth:.....I...\nRuth:I just...\n\nRuth:I thought that after all that effort I put in, someone would give a damn.\nRuth:I thought that if I structured my life and cleaned myself up that I would be accepted!\nRuth:But instead I just feel... alone. I'm financially stable, reasonably healthy, but I...\nRuth:But I just get trodden on by people who don't even know me.\nRuth:No one even knows how hard it was to push myself like that.
