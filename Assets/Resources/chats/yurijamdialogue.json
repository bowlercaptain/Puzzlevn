Lucky... that came with the GS exclusive 'Intention Flux' armor set...\nAanya*:It did have that armor, didn't it?\n->It wasn't as strong as the armor set I already had...\n    Aanya.apology:The promo set wasn't really that strong though.\n    ????:Isn't it better that way? Like really strong items can only be obtained by hard work.\n    Aanya*:Or money.\n    Aanya.default:I've found it kinda weird that a lot of the so-called legendary items aren't as good as some of the rare ones, though.\n    <<emote ruth happy>>\n    ????:But if everyone just picked the strongest item, the game would look really... silly. I mean, I still use 'Paradox Manual' even though 'Matter Formula' is strictly better.\n    ????:Sometimes you just want to use an item that your character would enjoy!\n    Aanya.apology*:Like all the players that wear cosmetic armor into battle for... roleplaying?\n->It still looked really cool.\n    Aanya.happy:The art they used for it was really beautiful.\n    <<emote ruth happy>>\n    ????:Right? The lore behind the set sent shivers down my spine! I think the Masked Queen is one of my favorite NPCs.\n    Aanya:She was the one that turned all of the captured prisoners into mirror copies of herself, right?\n    Aanya*:I also believe that was the fight that everyone complained about because it was way too hard...\n    ????:Yeah! I just loved how atmospheric the fight felt.\n    <<emote ruth worried>>\n    ????:I mean, until you were ganked by a dozen copies.\n    <<emote ruth happy>>\n    ????:But the throne room her fight was in... the detail in all the chains running across the floor...\n    ????:You felt in the presence of a real queen.\n#Ruth ringtone\n<<PlaySound ringtone>>\n#emote ruth lookingatherphone?\n#figured this would be good.

That's a relief!\nAanya.curious:You play a casting class?\nRuth:Yeah, Reverent Wizard type. Specializing in both DoTs and party healing! My equipment is mainly focusing on the DoT though.\nRuth:I liked the playstyle that came with it. You stack up a lot of damage when the fight first starts, then switch over to heals until the DoT wears off.\nRuth:I guess... it keeps me engaged with all parts of a raid, both allies and enemies.\nAanya:Huh. I guess the pure damage classes only have to worry about their enemies health and their own cooldowns. And even the guardian only really needs to keep an eye on enemy aggro.\nRuth.excited:The only class that doesn't really need to pay any attention is the Aegis Bulwark!\nAanya.happy:Yeah, it just stands there.\nAanya.apology*:I can't possibly say that I was originally going to play one...\n#Aanya happy\nRuth.curious:So, you ready to start the raid?\nAanya.happy:Yup.

If you need someone to listen to you- about anything- i'm here. Okay? I can't really do much about your work, or about the people you have to help.\nAanya:But I can lend an ear and a shoulder, if you want. In fact, i'd prefer if you do.\nAanya:But I also know that you are incredibly strong. What you told me proves that, without a doubt.\nAanya:I don't think that strength and being helped are mutually exclusive. The opposite, in fact.\nAanya:I-I guess what i'm saying is don't feel like you are being pigeonholed into one structure of life or another. If you feel that one way of living isn't working, there isn't shame in changing that.\nAanya:I mean, consider the consequences and all but-\nRuth:*chuckle*\nAanya*:I'm... rambling aren't I.\nRuth:You're rambling.\nRuth:But that's okay.\nAanya:You look like you've made yourself comfortable there.\nRuth:Aanya?\nAanya:Hm?\nRuth:Do you want to... spend the night?\nAanya*:H-huh?\n->I should get some stuff from my place but...\n    Aanya:I should run and get some things from my apartment, but yeah, i'd love to.\n->And maybe some groceries for dinner?

We'll probably want to get there a little early for good seats.\nRuth:Sure thing. Plus there's a special event outside the theater. Anyone with a theater ticket gets access to some bonus quests!\nAanya:Seriously?\nAanya*:That's some serious marketing they got going.\nRuth:I'm soooo hyped, though.
